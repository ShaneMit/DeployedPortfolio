      <p className="lead">Full stack web developer with a passion for creating aesthetically pleasing apps with user friendly interfaces. Recently graduated with a certificate in full stack development from University of California Irvine where I gained skills in HTML, CSS, Javascript, and React with a focus on being mobile first. I enjoy finding ways to make apps easy for the user to understand, solving problems, and learning new things. Recently, I was able to apply my newly acquired skills as part of a team to create a MERN app that allows the user to customize React components to create their own portfolio. I am excited to put my knowledge to work as part of a team to create better user experiences online.</p>
